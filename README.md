# Grammatical Arson

*The web will never be the same!*

Grammatical Arson will change your web experience forever, randomly swapping every instance of "there", "they're", and "their" for every web page.

GA comes in two distinct flavors:

* As an HTTP proxy written in Python

* As a Firefox extension written in JavaScript

The extension is a lot less likely to break things, but takes a bit more work to set up.

Enjoy!
